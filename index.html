        <h3>
          WHY SHOULD YOU CHOOSE US?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our team focuses on creating software for companies that don't have
          the resources to employ a full-time team of software developers. We
          provide services with a one time fee and a small monthly fee to handle
          maintenance and minor updates. Our bug-fixing team is always on
          standby to fix any errors in the systems we provide. This provides you
          with all of the services you would expect from a full-time staff
          without the high costs that come with continuously employing a
          personal team.
