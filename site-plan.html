      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        How many tasks in your business need to be accomplished everyday that
        you would rather have a computer do for you? How often do you find
        yourself and your employees performing tedious tasks that consume a lot
        of company time? What you need is quality computer programs specifically
        designed for your companies needs. My team of software designers and
        developers can produce quality software that is completely customized to
        what you need. Once purchased, we even provide regular maintenance for a
        low monthly cost so our service is risk free!
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This website will target business owners. I think that our main clients
        would be small businesses who don't have the funds to hire a full-time
        development team. Good software, including websites, can make a huge
        difference for a small company which is just getting started. I think
        that when they see the website, they will want our services so that they
        can boost their appeal to their customers. I will make the website as
        minimalistic and cleanly organized as possible so that it appeals to
        young entrepreneurs.

      <p>
        My website for the final project will be a website for the fabricated
        company Durango Heights Development. The website is designed
        specifically to appeal to potential customers and convince them to
        employ the services of Durango Heights Development. Durango Heights
        development is a software development agency which sells customized
        software to a wide range of buyers, from small businesses to large
        corporations. These services will benefit the customer because they will
        not need to hire a dedicated software development team. This will save
        them money on hiring and it will keep their software low-maintenance and
        consistently up-to-date. Why will people come to my site? People will
        come to my site because it offers them an easy solution to one of their
        more complex problems. Software development is very expensive. While it
        can remove many different tedious or complicated tasks and mitigate
        errors, it is not always easy to obtain. Often people who would want
        this type of service simply donâ€™t have the money or time to hire their
        own software development team. That is why people will come to our site.
        They will see that there is a way for them to obtain high quality
        software without spending large amounts of time and money one finding
        and employing their own team.

        What questions will my visitors expect my site to answer for them?
        Visitors to my site will expect a few of their questions to be answered.
        First, they will come to the website hoping to see how employing us will
        be better than continuing to do things the way they do. The website will
        show an in-depth analysis of our service and the potential financial
        gain available to the company for using our services. Second, they will
        want to know how our services are better than services offered by
        competitors. To show them that we are a better option, the site will
        show that our software initial costs are higher, but that we have a very
        low maintenance cost which will lower the cost over time. Third, they
        will want to know if they can trust the quality of software we produce.
        We will then refer to the credibility of our programs and the
        expectation for quality that we uphold within the company. We will also
        give a breakdown of our developers so they can see the experience and
        education of each employee.

        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on my site? I
        hope to have an interactive site that is not only informative, but also
        gives the customer an opportunity to get a hands-on feel for what the
        company is capable of and what we have to offer. One of the things the
        customer should be able to do on the website is get an estimate for the
        potential cost of a service and the time it will take for the service to
        be provided. I will place interactive tools that will give them a chance
        to see exactly what we can do for them. What information will we supply
        so that they can take actions that our site offers? We will provide them
        with at least three forms of contact that they can use if they desire
        our services as well as a request form that they can submit in the
        website to get an estimate for how much it will cost and how much time
        it will take for us to provide a service to them.
