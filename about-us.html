              programs to make sure that they are working perfectly before we
              send them to you. Doug has 25 years of experience inspecting the
              code at Nasa, so you know he'll do a good job.

            </h2>
            <p>
              James is easily the smartest person in our company. James is in
              charge of project planning. His small team takes the big projects
              you request and breaks them down to figure out what we will need
              to do to build them. His team of system designers work hard to
              make sure that we are always writing your software the best way
              possible before we even begin development. James graduated at the
              top of his class at MIT in 2019 and has worked hard since to earn
              the title of System Architect. Know that your software is being
              planned correctly because of James and his team.
